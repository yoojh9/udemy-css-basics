## 2) WEB DESIGN RULES #1: TYPOGRAPHY

### (1) SERIF vs SANS-SERIF

- **serif**

  - serif는 좀 더 전통적인 형태라서 전통적이거나 고전적인 느낌을 줄 수 있음
  - Creates a traditional / classic look and feel
  - Conveys trustworthiness
  - Good for long text

- **sans-serif**
  - sans-serif는 좀 더 깔끔해 보인다.
  - Modern look and feel
  - Clean and simple
  - Easier to choose for beginner designer

### (2) Use Good Font Size and Weights

- Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
- It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
- Choose the right typeface according to our website personality
- When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a **"type scale"** tool or other pre-defined range
- Use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text
- For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
- For **headlines**, you can go really big(50px+) and bold(600+), depending on personality
- For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

### (3) Create a Good Reading Experience

- Under less than 75 characters per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
- Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural(this will come from experience)
- Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine
